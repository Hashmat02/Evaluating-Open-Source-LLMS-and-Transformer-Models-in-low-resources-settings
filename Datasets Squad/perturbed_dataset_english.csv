What distinguishes neurons is their capability to transmit signals to designated target cells across extensive distances. They convey these signals through an axon, a slender protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and branches out, usually with many offshoots, to various locations, sometimes close by, and at other times in remote regions of the brain or body.', 'The length of an axon can be remarkable: for instance, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) from the cerebral cortex were enlarged so that its cell body matched the scale of a human body, its axon, similarly enlarged, would turn into a cable several centimeters wide, stretching over a kilometer. These axons convey signals in the form of electrochemical impulses known as action potentials, which last for less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at rates of 1--100 meters per second. Some neurons generate action potentials continuously, at frequencies of 10--100 per second, often in irregular sequences; others remain inactive for the majority of the time but sporadically release a surge of action potentials.']",Brains of organisms are made up mostly of what two classes of cells?,What are the two primary classes of cells that make up the brains of organisms?,neurons and glial cells,FALSE
